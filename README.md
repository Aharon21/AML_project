# AML_project
This project aims to implement learning-to-rank methods and enhance them to build a systematic trading strategy. 
As described in the report, it is composed of three approches: a naive one (in order to be our benchmark), a LambdaMART and a YetiRank algorithms. 

To be run, the repository only needs to be cloned and run *pip install -r requirements.txt* before launching the notebook.

The code is composed of a notebook of five parts : 
* data extraction
* data processing/features engineering
* Models implementation
* Backtests
* Fine-tuning of LambdaMART
